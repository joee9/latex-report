This project is create in order to make starting a brand new set of notes or a report painless to start. Simply place the title matter in the "globals.tex" file, write chapters in their own files in the "parts" directory, and include in desired order in the "parts.tex" file. Overleaf will do the rest.

Make sure to create directories for your auxiliary files: ./parts/, ./images/, ./code/. This will help to keep the project well organized.
